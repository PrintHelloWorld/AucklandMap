Assignment 1 : Comp261

I completed core and completion.

I read all the data from the files using the datareader class to format
the data into lines of string. I then use the modelDataStorage class to construct
all the data structures of the model by passing the lines of data into the 
constructors of each model in order to construct the object.

I used modeldatastorage to keep a place where data could be accessed from all the
classes.

I used Maps for mostly everything to match the ID of the model to the 
model itself to avoid duplicates.

I created the trie in order to return roadnames with characters within 
the search box. I then once the string of the searchbox was accurate enough
to only return one match, would get the road from the HashMap of roadnames in
modeldatastorage. I used the tree like structure from 103, where a tree is broken into
a node class for each node, and a trie class in order to control the entire structure.

I tried to seperate a lot of my code into different classes in order to break
down the problems a lot more and make debugging a bit easier. I use the roadGraph class
basically to store selected models and return the size of the map.

Mapdrawer keeps hold of all the drawing related methods to draw the map

my main class AucklandMap basically interacts with the UI stuff.
